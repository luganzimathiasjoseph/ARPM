```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure MongoDB is running and update your `.env` file with:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/arpm
```

### 2. Populate Sample Data
Run the data population script to create sample categories and locations:
```bash
node populate-sample-data.js
```

### 3. Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm start
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Asset
1. Navigate to Assets ‚Üí Create Asset
2. Fill in required fields (marked with *)
3. Add technical specifications as needed
4. Configure accessories and software licenses
5. Set maintenance schedule
6. Submit the form

### Managing Asset Lifecycle
1. **Status Updates**: Use the status update endpoint to change asset status
2. **Asset Movement**: Track transfers between departments/locations
3. **Maintenance**: Log maintenance activities and schedule future maintenance
4. **Depreciation**: Automatically calculate current asset value

### Filtering and Search
- Search by Asset ID, Name, or Serial Number
- Filter by Status, Condition, Category, Department, or Location
- View statistics dashboard for quick insights

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Only admins and technicians can create/edit assets
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid authentication
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of asset changes and movements
- **User Assignment**: Track who is responsible for each asset

## Responsive Design

The system is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile devices

All components automatically adjust their layout and functionality based on screen size.

## Future Enhancements

- **Barcode Scanner Integration**: Mobile app for scanning asset tags
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Email notifications for scheduled maintenance
- **Asset Reports**: Advanced reporting and analytics
- **Integration**: Connect with procurement and accounting systems
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for field technicians

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Asset ID Generation**: If auto-generation fails, manually enter a unique ID
2. **Category/Location Missing**: Ensure sample data is populated first
3. **Permission Errors**: Verify user has appropriate role (admin/technician)
4. **Validation Errors**: Check required fields and data formats
